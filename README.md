## Why

<p>I hate applying for jobs, so i figured i could make my life a little bit easier by making a very simple (not cluttered with ads...yet) list of companies from the S&P 500.</p>
<p>I'm going to use this as a reference while applying, but also it was an excuse to build a scraper which i've never done before.
